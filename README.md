## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

'''
npm i 
'''

## Usage

In order to run the program the user will have to sign into their mysql account in the command line. They will then need to type SOURCE ./db/schema.sql. After that they can type quit, hit enter, and then type "npm run seed". After the user has seeded the database they will need to type "npm start". Once the server is running they can make requests to the server in order to change the database.
